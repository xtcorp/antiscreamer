JS script to change the volume of any video/audio tag to 0.01 by default and prevent fullscreen mode
You will not be able to change the volume in any way, script adds listeners to make sure that the volume will not be changed, so make excludes in Tampermonkey's menu sites that you trust

For Tampermonkey only!
