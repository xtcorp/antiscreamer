# AntiScreamer
JS script to change the volume of any video/audio tag to 0.01 by default and prevent fullscreen mode
### Using
Install Tampermonkey and drop .js into your browser. Install page will pop up
### Info
You will not be able to change the volume in any way or enter in fullscreen, script adds listeners to make sure that the volume/fullscreen mode will not be changed, so make excludes in Tampermonkey's menu for sites that you trust
